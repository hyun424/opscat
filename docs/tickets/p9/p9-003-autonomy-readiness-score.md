# P9-003 — Autonomy Readiness Score

## Outcome

Score whether the commander can proceed, needs approval, or must stop.

## Non-Negotiable Boundaries

- Do not add OIDC, SSO, login, password, browser session, or CSRF auth work.
- Do not add real production mutation, Kubernetes/cloud/database execution, unrestricted shell execution, customer credentials, or hosted SaaS claims.
- Do not claim unattended production operation.
- Automatic actions must remain local/mock, allowlisted, policy-gated, simulated, audited, and reversible.

## Allowed / Likely Paths

- `app/services/autonomy_readiness.py`
- `app/services/agent_reliability_score.py`
- `tests/test_autonomy_readiness.py`

## Implementation Plan

1. Read `docs/operations/p9-ticket-roadmap.md` and this ticket.
2. Inspect current P8 services/tests before editing.
3. Write RED tests for the acceptance criteria.
4. Implement the smallest deterministic local/mock service/UI/eval/docs slice.
5. Run targeted tests and static checks.
6. Report exact evidence and changed files.

## Acceptance Focus

- evidence sufficiency
- confidence
- blast radius
- reversibility
- simulation
- policy
- memory
- verification readiness

## TDD / Verification Plan

- RED: add/modify the ticket-specific tests first and verify they fail for the intended missing behavior.
- GREEN: implement minimal code/docs until the same targeted tests pass.
- Static checks: run `uv run --no-sync --extra dev ruff check app tests scripts` when code changes.
- Type checks: run `uv run --no-sync --extra dev mypy app tests scripts` for service/API changes.
- Final ticket evidence must mention no-auth/local-mock/no-production-mutation preservation.

## Completion Criteria

- Required tests pass.
- Output is deterministic and redacted where user/incident text appears.
- No external provider/network/shell execution is introduced unless already mocked and allowlisted.
- Ticket completion report lists code paths, tests, and verification evidence.
